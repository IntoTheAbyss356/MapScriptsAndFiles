# MapScriptsAndFiles
This is a repository for all of my Beat Saber Maps. I will list whatever I used to make them, such as Vanilla Beatsaber, Remapper, or HeckLib. 
You may use the files and effect in this repo to **Learn** as well as copy the code. 
However, you must **give credit** to me in the script(if you put the script anywhere such as Github) and map description!
Have fun, and learn some stuff, don't be mean:) 

*Also, if there are any issues with the code or whatever, let me know in the issues*
